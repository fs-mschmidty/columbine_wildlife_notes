Species distribution models were developed using gps collar data collected in 2010, 2012, and 2013 in the Vail area and in the San Juan Mountains. Models were then used to determine what anthropocentric and environmental factors are disturbing lynx habitat.

## Model Notes

Seventeen variables were used to make the model. Topographic, vegetation and environmental variables were assessed. The most important variables in the model were precip as snow, relative humidity, Soil PH, Summer Precip, Topographic Position Index, Temp Coldest Month. The rest were relatively unimportant. PH was used to assess wetter conditions of subalpine forests. Lower PH is associated with wetter conditions.

Model was built with GPS collar data collected from 18 animals captured in the Vail area and the San Juan Mountains. The model was evaluated using camera trap data, snow track surveys, and Den locations. Thirty percent of the GPS data was used to build the model and 70% of the data was used to validate the model.

## Disturbance Metrics

Overall natural disturbances (exacerbated by climate) were far greater impact to lynx habitat then anthropogenic. To assess impacts to habitat, the model was classified into three categories: 1) Unlikely or >95% isopleth, 2) Likely or 95% and Core or 50%. Ninety-five percent or Likely represented the portion of the model that 95% of the withheld (70%) validations points fell within.

Natural disturbance altered forest structure in 31%% of Likely and 19% of high-quality Core habitat. Spruce beetles overlapped 25% of Likely habitat and 17% of Core habitat. Fire Disturbance across the Southern Rockies overlapped just 5% of Likely lynx habitat. Anthropogenic disturbances from housing and ski areas impacted just 4% of Likely lynx habitat and tree harvest and controlled burning had ~3% of impact.
