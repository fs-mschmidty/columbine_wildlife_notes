## Large Stand Replacing Fires Always Occurred.

> _"It may be helpful for public education programs on fire hazard reduction to emphasize that although frequent surface fires were most common in ponderosa pine stands, mixed and stand-replacement fires did occur in prehistoric times, and that during years of high fire hazard, stand-replacement fires may occur again despite fuels reduction programs"_

It seems that while stand replacing fires were uncommon, they still occurred, and despite our best efforts at fuels mitigation they will continue to occur.

## Fires Occurred in the Late Summer and Early Fall

## Structure

> _"Stands were historically open with varied age class distributions... Cooper [75] found that on the Fort Apache Reservation of east-central Arizona, where frequent prescribed burning is practiced, ponderosa pine grew in a mosaic of small (about 0.2-acre (0.08 ha)), even-aged groups that were maintained by fire. Trees were widely and randomly spaced. In contrast, structure in an unburned virgin stand on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest was uneven-aged with trees in small, uneven-aged groups. Pole-sized trees predominated, with scattered presettlement trees 14.5 to 41 inches (37-104 cm) DBH, and dense thickets of saplings [77]. (The Fire Ecology section of this report compares of pre- and postsettlement structure of this stand.) Laven and others [198] found presettlement stands on the central Colorado Front Range tended to have widely spaced, uneven-aged trees. Grouping patterns were not evident [77]."_

## Fire Return Interval

Fire return interval averages ~21 years. Large fire occurrence occurred every ~41 years.
