This document is notes on Northern Goshawks (*Accipiter gentilis*) generally with specific information pertaining to Goshawks on the Columbine District of the San Juan National Forest.

## Why are Goshawks Important to the San Juan?

* **Goshawks are declining accross North America.** ([1](https://www.rpi-project.org/species-conservation-northern-goshawk-accipiter-gentilis/)) Migratory monitoring locations accross the Unites States show a 46% decline in detections from 2009 to 2019. eBird trend estimates show declines accross their range. eBird data has does not have enough data to determine trend in most of Region 2.
* **Goshawks require relatively dense forest stands for nesting.** Activities that reduce nest stand density decrease potential nest stand quality.  It has been shown that nest stands that have been reduced in tree density show a significan decrease in nest site fidelity.
* **Goshawks show high Nest Site Fidelity.** Goshawks return to the same territory year after year, often for life, and nest stands can be used by multiple generations.
* **We don't know that much about Goshawks on the San Juan.** Given the above, we don't know that much about Goshawks.  We don't know how many nests we have, we don't know how many nests are active and we don't know how our activities are affecting goshawks. Dolores RD has done the most to determine their status.  But staff time drastically limits how much we know about the species and its status.

But this leads me to my next issue. I'm not sure we will ever know as much as we want to because surveys are time intensive, hard to time phenologically and because goshawks don't nest every year.

## Goshawk Nest Survey Methodology Summary

There are four methods to find goshawk nest sites:

1. **Dawn accustical surveys** - During early breeding (March 15th to April 28th - courtship, prior to female laying eggs) establish listening stations.  Helpful if you know if it is good habitat or you are near a nest.

> "*single-visit detection rates obtained with this method are about 97 percent at goshawk sites with active nests, 73 percent at sites with occupied nonbreeding status, and 43 percent at unoccupied historical nest stands (table 3.1). If survey objectives require detection of sites with nonbreeding adults, then two visits are required to achieve detection rates greater than 90 percent.*"

2. **Intensive Search Survey** - Closely spaced, 20m to 30m apart, surveys where surveyors look for Goshawk sign.  Sign can be nests, feathers, whitewash or prey remnants. Broadcast call can be done coincidentally.
3. **Broadcast Accoustical** - Broadcast call transects that are less than 250m apart, with call points 200m apart along a transect.  Transects should be staggered 100m from one tranect to the another, so that call points better cover an area. Surveys should occur from June 1 to August 15. At each calling station, broadcast at 60 degrees from the transect line for 10 seconds, then listen and watch for 30 seconds. Repeat this sequence two more times, rotating 120 degrees from the last broadcast. During the nestling stage, broadcast the adult alarm call. During the late nestling and fledgling stages, broadcast the juvenile begging or wail call. This call is more likely to elicit responses from juvenile goshawks.
4. **Aerial Survey** - Survey froma plane or drone.

Intensive search and broadcast accoustical survey will typically be used the most.

| **Survey Type** | **Timing** | **Nest Status** | **1st Visit Succes** | **2nd Visit Success** | **3rd Visit Success** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dawn accustical surveys | Local Dependent | Nesting | 97% | NA | NA |
|  |  | Occupied nonnnesting | 73% | ~90% | NA |
|  |  | Unoccupied Historical | 43% | NA | NA |
| Intensive Search Survey | late June through August | Nesting | 97% | 100% | 100% |
|  |  | Occupied nonnesting | 74% | 93% | 98% |
|  |  | Unoccupied Historical | 43% | 67% | 81% |
| Broadcast Accoustical | June 1 to August 15 | Nesting | 90% | 94% | 100% |
|  |  | Occupied nonnesting | 64% | 87% | 96% |
|  |  | Unnoccupied Historical | 36% | 59% | 73% |

## Goshawk Nest Survey Timing in Relation to Projects.

Two survey methods will be used the most, Broadcast Accoustical and Intensive Search.  These surveys should be conducted either the year before a project is conducted or the year the project is conducted prior to project implementation.  In some cases surveys prior to one year before the project is implemented may be allowed if an effeciency is gained.

## What will we do after we find a Goshawk Nest

### Definition of Important habitat areas (Renolds et. al 1992)

**Nest Areas (30 acres each)** - *"Three suitable nest areas should be maintained per home range. In addition, three replacement nest areas per home range should be in a development phase, using intermediate treatment and prescribed fire. Suitable areas may be lost because of insect epidemics, catastrophic fire, or other factors. Nest areas are typified by one or more stands of mature or old trees and dense forest canopies. No adverse management activities should occur at any time in suitable nest areas. Desired forest conditions for the nest stands and management recommendations for maintaining and developing nest stands."*

**Post Fledging-Family Areas (PFA) (420 acres)** - *"The PFA contains a variety of forest conditions and prey habitat attributes. Interspersed small openings, snags, downed logs, and woody debris are critical PFA attributes. To sustain the desired canopy cover, size of trees, and the specified portions of different forest ages within the PFA, regeneration of 10 percent of the PFA may be required every 20 years. Other management tools, such as prescribed fire and removing understory trees, are suggested for sustaining other critical elements of goshawk habitat (Table 2). Small openings in the forest are desired habitat for some prey species and are required for forest regeneration (Fig. 6). If forested openings are 1.0 acre or greater in Ponderosa pine and mixed species, then 3 to 6 large mature and/or reserve old trees per acre should be left in groups. If spruce-fir forest openings are 0.5 acres or greater, a group of 6 reserve trees are required per 0.5 acres. Reserve trees are not necessary in smaller openings; this component can be met in adjacent forested areas.. Ponderosa pine and other seral conifers can be planted, and, depending on forest type, aspen and oak regeneration are encouraged. Snags, downed logs, and woody debris should be present throughout the PFA. All management activities in the PFA should be limited to the period from October through February. Prescribed burning is the preferred method for management of woody debris. Thinning from below (removing understory trees) is preferred for maintaining desired forest structures, and a variable spacing of trees is preferred for developing groups of trees with interlocking crowns. Road densities should be minimized, and permanent skid trails should be used in lieu of permanent roads. Forage utilization should average 20 percent by weight and should not exceed 40 percent in any area to maintain grass and forb layer. Browse utilization should average 40 percent by weight (Table 2). These recommendations are designed to provide foods (leafy material, berries) and cover for goshawk prey."*

**Foraging Area (5,400 acres)** - *"Both the desired conditions and the management recommendations for the foraging area are similar to the PFA. The distribution and proportion of vegetative structural stages and the requirements for habitat attributes such as reserve trees, snags, and downed logs are the same as the PFA. Because the foraging area need not provide hiding cover for fledgling goshawks, a more open canopy is preferred -- 40 percent in the mid-aged forests and 40 to 60 percent in the mature and old forests, depending on the forest type. Openings (up to 4 acres), for herbaceous and shrubby understory development and tree regeneration, are desired in ponderosa pine and mixed-species forests; smaller openings are desired in spruce-fir forests (Table 1). Specific management recommendations to obtain the desired conditions for the foraging area are identical to the PFA (Table 2)."*"

## Document Excerpts:

### Forest Service Region 2 Sensitive

The Northern Goshawk is the listed as sensitive in Forest Service Region 2.
[Rationale for Listing](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5253676.pdf):

> Crocker-Bedford (1998) found that nest fidelity decreased significantly in harvested forests from that found in unharvested forests.

> Some 90 percent of the species habitat in the Southern Rockies is found on National Forest System lands. Consequently, the landscape level management strategies of the Forest System has substantial potential for determining the future of this species within the ecosystems of R2.

From the [Sensitive Species listing Evalution](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5369460.pdf):

> Forests in the region vary dramatically in their goshawk survey techniques and locations that are surveyed. Some Forests like the Medicine Bow/Routt and Black Hills have a large timber program and conduct numerous goshawk surveys. Other Forests such as the White River and San Juan have a relatively small timber program and have conducted very limited goshawk surveys. This leads to very large discrepancies in the data between forests and habitat types. For example on the Brush Creek/Hayden District of the Med/Bow over 100 nests have been documented mostly from transects used to clear timber sales. On the entire White River NF with more habitat acreage, only approximately 15-20 nests are known and the majority of those have been found in areas not officially surveyed, but were observations from the public or agency personnel

> The R2 Goshawk team (2) found that actual population trend data for goshawks is very limited within the region. The USFWS, (3) itself stated that the majority (75%) of reported territories analyzed for the status review were discovered in the last 10 years. The R2 goshawk team was not able to find any experts within the region that could supply population trend data. The team further suggested that nest monitoring and other protocols be undertaken region wide in order to begin the baseline information data gathering that could be used later for population trend projections.

> Kennedy (7) after a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed research concluded that there is no strong evidence to indicate that goshawk populations are declining, increasing or stable. She also stated that 1) either the goshawk is not declining or 2) current sampling techniques are insufficient to detect population trends.

>In the Southern Rockies Region 93.8% of all the land acreage is within 0-2 miles of a road

> Squires (6) indicated nesting habitat is the most important component in limiting B distribution and numbers of birds. In the Black Hills Forest Plan Revision, the experts( Squires, Reynolds) considered a lack of providing landscape level nesting habitat as a major negative effect.
