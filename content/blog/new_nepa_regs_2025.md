From Laurel Glidden, San Juan NEPA Coordinator:

A quick rundown of changes we know so far:

- All USDA agency NEPA regulations, including Forest Service CE categories, can now be found at 7 CFR 1b. Emergency response information can be found at [7 CFR 1b.9(w)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalregister.gov%2Fd%2F2025-12326%2Fp-998&data=05%7C02%7CMichael.Schmidt4%40usda.gov%7Cc80fb5b86ab645925bc208ddbd5f06b2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638874938057749863%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=KVZcyOtkW5wijs5DNLlyLAgWMqMyzv1GIUx18N3%2F9XU%3D&reserved=0) and Forest Service CE categories can be found at [7 CFR 1b.4(c)(19)-(c)(29)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalregister.gov%2Fd%2F2025-12326%2Fp-468&data=05%7C02%7CMichael.Schmidt4%40usda.gov%7Cc80fb5b86ab645925bc208ddbd5f06b2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638874938057765096%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=0CGiD2vy2OulHBX%2B2HVSwkBL9x78VnQ4Gj%2FOC9fL344%3D&reserved=0) and [7 CFR 1b.4(d)(26)-(d)(47)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalregister.gov%2Fd%2F2025-12326%2Fp-651&data=05%7C02%7CMichael.Schmidt4%40usda.gov%7Cc80fb5b86ab645925bc208ddbd5f06b2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638874938057779007%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mKfB2q1LvKGQOUZxvVhSQBkwgtuuYlb3lICVBDynaoc%3D&reserved=0). Please see the attached list for viewing changes made to emergency response and CE categories, as well as old & new categories.
- All USDA and sub-agency CEs, including adopted CEs from other agencies, are now available to the Forest Service and all other USDA agencies. - Our list of extraordinary circumstances has changed slightly to be consistent across the USDA. The new list can be found at [7 CFR 1b.3(f)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalregister.gov%2Fd%2F2025-12326%2Fp-288&data=05%7C02%7CMichael.Schmidt4%40usda.gov%7Cc80fb5b86ab645925bc208ddbd5f06b2%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638874938057792640%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=M0Q3ylqUL%2BunDtOBLkfz7jQ%2F7Zq7TAqhPbweM5KMwYw%3D&reserved=0).
- Requirements for the following have been removed (NOTE: This is only as applies to NEPA and does not affect requirements from other laws, such as Endangered Species Act (ESA), Clean Water Act (CWA), National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), etc.):
  - Scoping for Categorical Exclusions (CEs) and Environmental Assessments (EAs)
  - Decision Memos (CEs) and Decision Notices (EAs)
    - There are still requirements for documentation of some CE categories, same as before. The new regulations require documentation of a “finding of applicability and no extraordinary circumstance” (FANEC) and gives agencies flexibility to decide what that documentation will look like but lays out some requirements for information that must be included. This information can be found at [7 CFR 1b.3(g)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/07/03/2025-12326/national-environmental-policy-act#p-300)
    - Additionally, [Environmental Assessment](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/07/03/2025-12326/national-environmental-policy-act#p-758) documents and a [Finding of No Significant Impact](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/07/03/2025-12326/national-environmental-policy-act#p-784) are still required, and if other statutes or regulations require a decision document, the FONSI can be retitled to function as a decision document.
  - Publication of a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
  - Schedule of Proposed Actions (SOPA)
    - Note: Forest Service units may use project webpages to provide updates to the public
    - Cumulative effects analysis
      - Instead, effects must be “reasonably foreseeable and have a reasonably close causal relationship to the proposed action or alternatives”.
      - This does not remove the requirement for cumulative effects from other laws, only NEPA. So, for example, we may still be required to do cumulative effects via ESA and we are being encouraged to consolidate documentation where it makes sense to do, so it may be that little changes here in reality.
- EAs and EISs must now contain certifying statements saying they were completed within the statutory timeframes (one and two years, respectively).

## Notes:

- Cumulative Effects for ESA are not the same as NEPA. They generally just cover non-federal reasonably certain to occur actions. The thought being is that all Federal Actions would have already had consultation.
  - NEPA Cumulative Effects: "_The impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such other actions 40 CFR §1508.7._"
  - ESA Cumulative Effects: "_Cumulative effects are those effects of future State or private activities, not involving Federal activities that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the Federal action subject to consultation(§402.02)_"
